#### CHANGE REVIEW FEEDBACK

**Review 1**

I might be misunderstanding this, but there appears to be a lot of data
in your raw folder that is not actually used in the report. I recommend
deleting any files/folders that are ultimately not needed for the
analysis to make your repo cleaner.

-   Response : We identified files and folders that were not
    contributing to the analysis . We have since cleaned up the raw
    folder by removing any unnecessary files, ensuring that the
    repository is more organized and easier to navigate. This cleanup
    improves the overall clarity and usability of the project

**Review 2**

This is more minor, but it would be nice to have a link in the license
section of the README.

-   Response : A link have been added to the link session

**Review 3**

The README documentation is nicely partitioned into sections. However,
it is a bit unclear as to how I'm supposed to set up the environment. In
the usage section, you've written that we should use the environment.yml
file, but in the setup it says we should use docker compose up. It may
also be helpful to users to incorporate screenshots into the
instructions.

-   Response : We updated the setup instructions for running the
    analysis by replacing the incorrect information with the correct
    command: docker compose up. This ensures the setup process is clear
    and accurate for all users. The updated instructions can now be
    followed without confusion or errors. A screenshot has been added.

**Review 4**

It looks like the README.md's references section is written in the wrong
format. I believe that this was copy-pasted from the reference.bib file
inside the report section. This could be reformatted to a regular
markdown format.

-   Response : We have now reformatted the references into a standard
    markdown format, making them more readable and appropriate for the
    README.md.
