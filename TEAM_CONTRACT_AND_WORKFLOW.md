### Analysis Requirements:

### 	Introduction:

* Provide background information on the topic to help the reader understand the rest of the report. (3)
* Clearly state the research question addressed by the project. (3)
* Identify and describe the dataset used to answer the question. (3)

### 	Methods & Results:

* Describe the methods used for the analysis in written English, narrating the code that performs each step.

* The report should include code that:

* Loads data from the original web source. (1)
* Cleans and wrangles the data from its raw format to one suitable for classification or clustering analysis. (1)
* Performs a summary of the dataset, relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned classification. (1)
* Creates a relevant visualization for exploratory data analysis. (1)
* Performs classification or regression analysis. (2)
* Creates a visualization of the analysis results. (2)

* Note: All tables and figures should have a number and a legend.

### 	Discussion:

* Summarize the findings. (2)
* Discuss whether the results were expected. (2)
* Discuss the potential impact of these findings. (2)
* Explore future questions that could arise from this analysis. (2)

### Team Contract

### Expectations:
•	Each group member is expected to spend a maximum of 6 hours per week on DSCI 522 unless agreed otherwise by the team.

•	All submissions must be timely and meet the milestones as outlined in the instructions. This includes ensuring that all scripts work, creating tests for all functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

### Communication:
•	All communication outside of meetings will be done via Slack or GitHub. GitHub will be the primary platform for sharing ideas, submitting and reviewing work, and providing feedback. Slack will be used for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

•	Team members agree to maintain open communication throughout the project.

•	If a team member is unable to complete a task by the deadline, they should inform the team at least 24 hours in advance to allow time to redistribute the task.

### Meetings:

•	The team will hold regular check-ins online or in-person at the MCLD, 3rd floor study area on the following schedule:

o	Every Thursday: 4pm-6pm

o	Every Monday: 4pm-6pm (if needed)

o	Every Tuesday: 2pm-4pm

•	In addition to the check-ins, all members are expected to attend the labs. If a member cannot attend a lab, they must notify the team the night before to discuss alternative arrangements.

### Workflow:

•	All team members are expected to follow version control best practices as taught in class, including but not limited to:

o	Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
o	Keep branches small.
o	Use meaningful branch names.

•	Each member must submit a pull request for their work on the project repository on GitHub. Members should add teammates as reviewers to ensure all pull requests are reviewed by another member.
